# CNN-FaceEmotion-Detector
## Facial Emotion Recognition App using CNN
This project implements a Facial Emotion Recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emotions from facial expressions. The trained CNN model detects emotions in real-time or from uploaded images, and it is integrated into an easy-to-use application.

Key Features:
- Detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more from facial images.
- Supports both real-time emotion detection via webcam and analysis of uploaded images.
- Visualizes detected emotions with a radar chart and provides percentage breakdowns for each emotion.
- Built using TensorFlow/Keras for the CNN model and Streamlit for the application interface.
